Homework 1 by Ignacio Esteban Diaz Ruiz

This is a static HTML website where I fixed semantic tags and some CSS code.

The task I was given was remove all unncessary code and make code easier to understand. Code given had a lot to double classes and id's that were not giving
any specific feature. As well as that, sematic tags had not been used at all, then I fixed that based on information provided in class.

To complete this homework I took around 5 hours, removing all unnecesary lines, double lines and classes.

As well as that, I left some comments to make it easier to read and understand.

Al classes and id's have descriptive names to understand what they do easier.
