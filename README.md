Homework 1 by Ignacio Esteban Diaz Ruiz

This is a static HTML website where I fixed semantic tags and some CSS code.

Indise folder Homework1-Code there are all assets and HTML code used to complete this task.

To complete this homework I took around 5 hours, removing all unnecesary lines, double lines and classes.

As well as that, I left some comments to make it easier to read and understand.

Al classes and id's have descriptive names to understand what they do easier.
